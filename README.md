# Members-Only
Project: Members Only - The Odin Project

# Summary 
Built an exclusive clubhouse where only members can see who the author of a post is. Practiced my authentication  and database skills.
Set up database models for the users and messages post adajacent to a database set up on Mongo. Used the bcrypt module to ensure the 
privacy of the user's password. Users are not atuomatically members nor admins but they can become one after entering the secret phrase.
A user is able to sign up and log in as well as delete their personal posts.
